 Problem Statement
    
When a widget breaks, it is sent to the widget repair shop, which is capable of repairing at most numPerDay widgets per day. Given 
a record of the number of widgets that arrive at the shop each morning, your task is to determine how many days the shop must operate 
to repair all the widgets, not counting any days the shop spends entirely idle.
For example, suppose the shop is capable of repairing at most 8 widgets per day, and over a stretch of 5 days, it 
receives 10, 0, 0, 4, and 20 widgets, respectively. The shop would operate on days 1 and 2, sit idle on day 3, and operate again 
on days 4 through 7. In total, the shop would operate for 6 days to repair all the widgets.
Create a class WidgetRepairs containing a method days that takes a sequence of arrival counts arrivals (of type int[]) and an 
int numPerDay, and calculates the number of days of operation.
