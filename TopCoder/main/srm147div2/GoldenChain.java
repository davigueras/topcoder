Problem Statement
    
Background
I remember a chain problem from my childhood. Suppose you have four sections of a golden chain. Each consists of three links joined 
together in a line. You would like to connect all four sections into a necklace. The obvious solution is to cut the last link of each 
section and use it to connect the first section to the second one, then the second to the third, then the third to the fourth, then 
the fourth to the first one. If you want to minimize the number of cuts, you can do better. You can cut one of the three link sections 
into its individual links. Using the three loose links you can join the three remaining sections together.
Your task is, given the lengths of the sections, to return the minimum number of cuts to make one big circular necklace out of all of them.
