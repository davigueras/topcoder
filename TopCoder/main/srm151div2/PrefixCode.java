Problem Statement
    
A prefix code is a set of words in which no word is a prefix of another word in the set. A word v is said to be a prefix 
of a word w if w starts with v.  An important property of prefix codes is that they are uniquely decodable. Prefix codes 
are commonly used - telephone numbers are an everyday example (as you probably don't want a stranger to pick up the phone 
call you make just because his number is a prefix of the number you intend to dial). Prefix codes are also very popular in 
computer science, the Huffman code used for data compression being a famous example.  Given a String[] words, return the 
String "Yes" if that set of words is a prefix code or return the String "No, i" if it is not, where i is replaced by the 
lowest 0-based index of a String in words that is a prefix of another String in words. (That index should have no extra leading zeros.)

Definition
    
Class:
PrefixCode
Method:
isOne
Parameters:
String[]
Returns:
String
Method signature:
String isOne(String[] words)
(be sure your method is public)
    

Notes
-
Letters are case sensitive (e.g. "No" is not a prefix of "not").
-
Do not forget the single space between the comma and i in "No, i"
Constraints
-
words contains between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
-
Each element of words contains between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive.
-
Each element of words consists only of characters '0'-'9', 'A'-'Z' and 'a'-'z', inclusive.
-
No two elements of words are equal (as the input represents a set).
Examples
0)

    
{"trivial"}
Returns: "Yes"
As there is only one word, no word can be the prefix of another, so this is a trivial example of a prefix code.
1)

    
{"10001", "011", "100", "001", "10"}
Returns: "No, 2"
"100" (at index 2) and "10" (at index 4) are both a prefix of "10001" and "10" is also a prefix of "100", therefore it is no prefix code. "100" is the prefix with the lowest index.
2)

    
{"no", "nosy", "neighbors", "needed"}
Returns: "No, 0"

3)

    
{"1010", "11", "100", "0", "1011"}
Returns: "Yes"

4)

    
{"No", "not"}
Returns: "Yes"
